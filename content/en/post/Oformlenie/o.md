# Preparation of a report on laboratory work

Laboratory work is a small research work, which should be executed according to all approved requirements. When preparing a report on laboratory work, you will master a number of important elements that will be useful to you in the future when writing a course and thesis.

## Report structure

According to GOST 7.32-2001, any research work must necessarily contain the following elements:

– title page;

– summary;

– introduction;

– the main part;

– conclusion.

GOST also recommends including such elements in the work:

– list of performers;

– content;

– regulatory references;

– definitions;

– designations and abbreviations;

– list of sources used;

– applications.

If you are carrying out complex work performed in several stages, then you may need to include part or all of the elements of the second list in the work.

## The content of the main elements of the report

– Title page. 

The first sheet of work is drawn up strictly according to the pattern that is usually given in the manuals on your subject. It is not just required to specify elements such as the name of the educational institution, the type of work and information about the performer, but also to arrange them in strict accordance with the standards.

– Abstract. 
The abstract is actually a summary of your entire report and contains a number of statistical information. In it, you need to specify the number of parts, pages of the work, illustrations, appendices, tables, used literary sources and appendices. Here is also a list of the keywords of the work and the actual text of the abstract. The latter implies the main elements of the work
from the set goals to the results and recommendations for their implementation. In the practice of universities, the abstract is usually not included in the reports on laboratory work.

– Introduction. 
In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, the goals of the study and the tasks that are performed are usually prescribed

# Conclusion

In this part of the work, you will need to draw conclusions from the results obtained during the laboratory work. To do this, evaluate how fully the
tasks have been completed. Other elements may be present in complex works,
for example, recommendations for further application of the results
of the work carried out.
